# TopoBot
## My silly take on home automation

I developed this Slackbot to automate my home in a fun way. The idea is to provide commands to a Slackbot, which looks like a mouse, hence the name TopoBot, that runs integrated scripts, managing all the different connected elements of my home.

So far the bot can control two main systems:
* Philips Hue Lights - one bridge with five bulbs
* Sonos - Two Sonos devices

Have a look at the code, take what you need, play as you like.

I have been inspired by [The NorrisBot](https://scotch.io/tutorials/building-a-slack-bot-with-node-js-and-chuck-norris-super-powers), and I used a few libraries to get this done.
